# To add a new article to the blog follow the next guide:

## First, we need to add a new <article class="blog-post"> element in the index.html file, inside the <div class="blog-container">.
## After we added the article with that class, we need to add one img element inside the article, with the corresponding src and alt attributes.
## Finally, we need to add a h3 element with the title of the blog post.
## To link the article in the index.html, to a new blog post page, we need to wrap the article element in an <a> tag with the href attribute pointing to the new blog post page.
## The new blog post page should be created in the posts directory and should have a .html extension.

# To write the new article page, you need to create a new HTML file in the posts directory with a meaningful name, for example, "my-first-post.html".
## Then, you have to add the basic HTML structure to the new file, including the DOCTYPE declaration, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
## You can copy those from this template.

## With that basic, you just fill the corresponding <article> element with the content of your blog post. And don't forget the title and images of the new post page.
